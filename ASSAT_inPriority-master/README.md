#ASSAT_inPriority  
We implement a specialized SAT solver for solving the preferred extensions problem , and configure it on state-of-the-art abstract argumentation algorithm ArgSemSAT(abbr. ASSAT).   
ArgSemSAT is the winner of the preferred semantics track of the [International Competition of Computational Models of Argumentation 2017](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2017/index.html)

Due to the differences in the instance formats of ICCMA 2023 and ICCMA 2021, the way the program reads the instances varies. Therefore, we designed different programs for ICCMA 2023 and ICCMA 2021 instances, and stored the source codes in the `code` folder under `Test ICCMA 2023` and `Test ICCMA 2021` respectively.
